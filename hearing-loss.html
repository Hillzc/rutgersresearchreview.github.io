      <h1>The Role of the DFNA5 Gene in Progressive Hearing Loss</h1>
      <h3>By: Daniel Kats</h3>
      <div class="article">
My name is Daniel Kats and I am a student researcher in the Schwander Lab in Nelson Biological Laboratories on Busch Campus. I am currently a member of the Class of 2018 in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program pursuing a major in Biological Sciences and a minor in Cognitive Science. After my undergraduate education at Rutgers, I plan on attending medical school and pursuing a career in cardiology or another specialized field of medicine in order to make advances in the outcomes of patients suffering from disease.

Research in the Schwander Lab is centered on the mechanisms and genes involved in progressive hearing loss. Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder in humans, present in about 1 out of every 500 newborns. In addition, a large fraction of the elderly population suffers from progressive hearing loss. Major causes of hearing loss are environmental factors, such as excessive noise, and genetic factors that damage sensory hair cells of the inner ear. Previous studies have linked the gene DFNA5, a member of the gasdermin gene family, to autosomal dominant progressive hearing loss in humans (Van Laer et al., 1998). Based on these studies, we hypothesize that mutations at the DFNA5 locus cause the expression of a truncated protein in sensory hair cells or other cell types of the inner ear, ultimately leading to hearing loss. In this project, we have been attempting to determine the physiological function of DFNA5 in the inner ear by characterizing a novel mouse model that allows for the overexpression of either wild-type or mutant DFNA5 via plasmid insertion in a spatiotemporally controlled manner using Cre-loxP technology. This technique allows the construct that contains the DFNA5 mutant DNA sequence to be expressed.

The Schwander Lab maintains a mouse colony that is used for testing purposes. To assess hearing function in wild-type and DFNA5 mutant mice, we measure the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and determine auditory thresholds. This involves placing anesthetized mice at either one or two months of age into a soundproof chamber with three electrodes inserted in the body. A loudspeaker is positioned directly inside of the right ear, and a connected RZ6 processor (TDT) generates click sounds and pure tones at various sound intensities and frequencies. ABR waveforms are recorded in a BioSigRZ program (TDT) and evaluated in Microsoft Excel. The lowest sound level that generates an ABR pattern of a clear waveform defines the hearing threshold.

We must also genotype the mice to provide a correlation between the genotype of a particular mouse and the results of its hearing tests. This genotyping is performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to verify the presence of both Cre-recombinase and the DFNA5 transgene. The Cre-recombinase allows us to see that the construct has inserted properly into the mouse genome, and can express the region of DNA that it surrounds. DNA extracted from mouse tail samples in a prepared solution undergoes elongation and amplification in a PCR machine. The final solution is run on an agarose gel that separates out strands of DNA. The results can be analyzed by comparing the separation patterns to expected lengths of the DNA strands to determine whether Cre and the DFNA5 transgene is present in each particular mouse.

Based on our preliminary data, we currently cannot conclude whether DFNA5 mutant mice develop hearing loss. The 25 mice in the colony that were used to collect our data were subjected to hearing tests at 1 and 2 months of age, and the data was compared to control mice with wild-type genes. In contrast to expectations, we did not observe elevated hearing thresholds above 50 decibels for the click ABR tests in any of the Cre-positive mice. Therefore, analysis of PCR genotyping and ABR results indicates a rift between our expected findings and the concrete evidence we obtained. We expected the overexpression of a mutant DFNA5 gene to lead to progressive hearing loss as a result of apoptosis in hair cells. However, this hypothesis has not been supported by our results; the low hearing thresholds in Cre-positive DFNA mutant mice at one and two months suggest that the mice are not deaf, and have not been developing worse hearing. We must continue this testing at the age of four months to attempt to determine the progressive nature of the disease. Moreover, their hearing has even slightly improved, but that is a possible result of slight variations in the placement of electrodes during testing, the extent to which the mice were anesthetized, or the relatively small number of mice that have been tested so far. In addition to the ABR results, the PCR genotyping results failed to detect the presence of the DFNA5 targeting vector in the mouse genome. There was likely a failure in the integration of the plasmid containing mutant DFNA5 (Fig. 1).

Nevertheless, we will continue to investigate the role of DFNA5 in progressive hearing loss, as the gene is implicated in the human form of the disorder. We have obtained a new colony of mice that contain an improved version of the DFNA5 construct, and we will breed this colony to expand it for use in the experiment. In the long term, we hope to continue to unravel the mystery behind the role of the DFNA5 gene in progressive hearing loss, in order to prevent or treat the disorder in humans.
