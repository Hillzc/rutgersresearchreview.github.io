              <h4 class="author">Writer: Anehita Oribabor</h4>
            <p>My name is Anehita Oribabor and am a member of the Class of 2017 pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering. I am from Pennsauken, NJ, and am the youngest of three sisters. In my spare time I practice yoga, painting, and playing my viola. I thrive when I am challenged to think creatively and critically. My quest for knowledge and fascination for the unknown greatly steered my collegiate pursuits. For the past several semesters, I have been conducting research on structural and material concepts for the astronomic cultivation of a settlement on the Moon. After graduating, I plan on studying robotics and design in graduate school. My advisor is Dr. Haym Benaroya in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.</p>

            <p>My name is Jaimie Swartz and I am from Edison, NJ. I am a member of the Class of 2017 and am pursuing a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Upon entering college, I decided that my ultimate dream job was to "manage the powering of a major city with 100% renewables." For the past several semesters, I have been part of a research team that is simulating precisely the energy community that I dreamed to build several years ago. I plan to continue research in graduate school on smart grids and optimal coordination of renewable energy sources. I work in the Laboratory for Energy Smart Systems, a research group led by Dr. Mohsen Jafari in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: Sruchika Sabu</h4>
            <p>My name is Sruchika Sabu and I am a senior majoring in Cell Biology and Neuroscience and minoring in Psychology at Rutgers University. I have worked in the Wu Lab for over 2 years and am continuously encouraged to expand my projects and actively contribute to the lab. During my final academic year, I plan on completing a departmental honors thesis. After that, I aspires to pursue M.D./Ph.D. degrees to delve further into the field of neuroscience and neuropathology.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: Wee Siang Tay</h4>
            <p>My name is Wee Siang Tay and I am a Class of 2019 international student from Singapore in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. I am majoring in Economics and currently work with Dr. Olga Jarr√≠n. Previously, I worked in a frontline clinical setting at a hospital and I served in the military. I was injured during my days of service, but I experienced genuine warmth from nurses who took care of me when I was a warded patient. My experiences with healthcare are in both as a provider and patient. The relief and gratitude I felt from nurses fuel my impetus to select the field of nursing to do research.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: David James Estrin</h4>
            <p>Optogenetics is a current tool used across disciplines to control membrane potential in genetically altered cells in vivo and in vitro. Dr. Gero Miesnb&ouml;ck introduced transgene expression in genetically modified mouse neurons to produce Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to control membrane potential via photostimulation, a procedure he later coined "optogenetics" (Zemelman et al., 2002; Lima & Miesenb&ouml;ck, 2005; Miesenb&ouml;ck & Kevrekidis, 2005; Miesenb&ouml;ck, 2009). By genetically modifying an animal's genome, scientists are able to photo-stimulate action potentials (APs) in distinct neurons subpopulations thus controlling the neuron's function.</p>

                <h4 class="author">Writer: Hemapriya Dhanasekaran</h4>
            <p>While a sexuality education system in the United States based off a public health framing educates students on how to prevent HIV/STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies, it does not teach the power and importance of sexual agency and pleasure, especially for women. Sexual agency is defined as the "the ability to advocate for one's interests in the sexual arena" (Bay-Cheng, 2003).</p>
