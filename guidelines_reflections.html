      <h1 class="center">Guidelines for Reflections Articles</h1><br>
      <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
      <p>If you are a Rutgers undergraduate student, Rutgers graduate student, or a Rutgers alumna/alumnus with previous research experience (academia or industry research), you are eligible to submit an article discussing your experience in a field of research. Discuss specific events from your experience in your field of research, your former and present points of view on research, and your advice to students who are interested in research.</p>
      <ul>
      <h3>Example questions to focus on:</h3>
      <li>How have your experiences shaped your perception of research and/or future goals?</li>
      <li>What important lessons have you learned from conducting research?</li>
      <li>If you have experience in both, how do research in academia and industry differ?</li>
      <li>How have your research experiences differed from your expectations?</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Please ensure that the article contains 500 to 1,500 words. Structure the article in an appropriate manner based on your topic of discussion.</p>
      <p>Submit your article to rutgersresearchreview[at]gmail[dot]com. Your article will be reviewed by a Rutgers Research Review editor who is familiar with your general field of research. The comments will be sent to you for revision. After you submit the second draft with the recommended changes to the editor, the editor will make any remaining edits and publish the article on the website.</p>
      <hr>
     <h2>Interview</h2>
      <p>If you are a Rutgers undergraduate student, you are eligible to submit an article that focuses on an interview with a Rutgers faculty member or Rutgers alumna/alumnus that has extensive experience and accomplishments in research.</p>
      <ul>
      <h3>About the Interviewee</h3>
      <li>Provide a general overview of the interviewee (two or three sentences). Include the occupation/position, duration of occupation, and the area of research specialization. Also, include any significant accomplishments.</li>
      <li>Give the general background information, including education and research experience, of the interviewee.</li>
      <h3>The Interview</h3>
      <li>Ensure to ask the following questions during the interview (in addition to these questions, ask questions pertinent to the work of your interviewee):</li>
      <li>Why did you choose to enter a career in research, particularly in your given field (i.e. general course of events that led to decision, specific events, interests, etc.)?</li>
      <li>How have your research interests changed over the years since you first began conducting research?</li>
      <li>What advice do you have for undergraduate students who are interested in or are currently conducting research?</li>
      <li>Structure the article in a question-answer format. Ensure that the written response from the interviewee is accurate (it would be best to have a laptop during the interview to type up the responses or voice recorder).</li>
      <h3>Final Remarks</h3>
      <li>Recount your interview and describe the important points that you personally took from the interview (~150 words).</li>
      </ul><br>
